## emscripten module wrapper

This is a wrapper to collect information needed to run WebAssembly modules generated by emscripten.

First the script `prepare.sh` add the wrapper to the js file that was generated. Then this file
can be ran using
```
node main.prep.js
```

This will collect the information about calls and memory changes that can be recorded, and used for verified computations.
